## Overview and Purpose

Senet is designed to provide a smooth and enjoyable shopping experience, allowing users to explore a wide variety of board games from the comfort of their own home. Whether you're into strategy, party games, or family favorites, our platform helps you discover the perfect game for any occasion.

From browsing to checkout, every step is optimized for convenience and clarity. Users can view detailed product descriptions, filter by genre or difficulty, and easily add games to their cart. ðŸ›’

At Senet, we believe in the power of play to connect people. Our goal is to make choosing and purchasing board games as enjoyable as playing them.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/), the application delivers a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Vue Router ensures smooth navigation across pages, while [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) provides utility-first styling for rapid and consistent UI development.

- **Data Management**: Powered by [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/), enabling efficient and scalable data fetching, caching, and synchronization across the application.

- **Bundling & Dev Server**: Uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for fast build times, instant hot module replacement, and an optimized developer experience.

- **Backend Integration**: Seamlessly connected with [Commerce Tools](https://docs.commercetools.com/docs), a modern commerce API platform that supports flexible and headless eCommerce architecture.

- **CI/CD**: Automated with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), ensuring reliable continuous integration and hassle-free delivery with each code update.

- **Code Quality & Formatting**: Maintained using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)for Git hooks,[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting, and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent formatting across the codebase.

- **Testing**: Ensures application reliability with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit and integration tests, providing a robust and fast testing environment tailored for modern frontend frameworks.
